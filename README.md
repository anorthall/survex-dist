# survex-dist
A command line utility for calculating the distance between two points in a [Survex](https://survex.com/) cave survey
file. `survex-dist` is not associated with the [Survex project](https://survex.com/), although I am very grateful for
their hard work!

## Features
### Implemented
* Process Survex 3D files to create a graph of the cave system.
* Calculate the shortest walking distance between any two stations in the cave system
  using A* pathfinding.
* Force a specific route through the cave by specifying survey stations to go via or exclude.
* Output to different formats: plain text, table, JSON.

### Planned
* Produce a graphical representation of the cave system and path.
* A web interface to allow the application to be used without installing it locally.
* Provide analysis of the cave system, such as the number of loops, number of entrances, etc.
* Provide analysis of various through trips in the cave system.

## Usage
### Installation
`survex-dist` is not presently available as a binary. You can build and install it yourself using `cargo`, the Rust
package manager. If you need to install `cargo`, see [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

To build and install `survex-dist` in your `cargo` bin directory (usually `~/.cargo/bin`), run the following command:
```text
cargo install survex-dist
```

### Via and avoid
`survex-dist` can ensure that a certain route is taken by specifying via stations. This is done
using the `--via` flag. For example, to ensure that the route passes through the station
`entranceshaft.005`, use the following command:
```text
> survex-dist tests/data/nottsii.3d nottsii.entrance entranceshaft.007 --via entranceshaft.005
```

In exactly the same way, the `--avoid` flag can be used to ensure that a route does not pass
through a certain station. Both `--via` and `--avoid` can be used multiple times. Note that
`--via` stations are processed in the order that they are specified, and may cause a route to
loop back.

### Station matching
You can use partial station names whenever specifying a survey station.

For example, the station `nottsii.committeepotentrance.entranceshaft.007` was specified as `entranceshaft.007` above.
The partial match will be accepted as long as it is unambiguous. If the partial match is ambiguous, `survex-dist` will
print a list of possible matches and exit:

```text
‚ùØ survex-dist tests/data/nottsii.3d nottsii.entrance entranceshaft
There were 35 possible matches for the station name 'entranceshaft'.

The first 20 matches were:

  nottsii.committeepotentrance.entranceshaft_2.15
  nottsii.committeepotentrance.entranceshaft_2.14
  nottsii.committeepotentrance.entranceshaft_2.13
  nottsii.committeepotentrance.entranceshaft_2.12
  ... snip ...
```
### Output format
The output format can be changed using the `--format` flag. The following formats are
supported:
- `table` (default)
- `text`
- `json`

### Survey analysis
`survex-dist` will, in the future, provide analysis of a survey using the `--analyse` flag. At
the moment, this flag does nothing.

### Further options
For a full list of options, run `survex-dist --help`.

`survex-dist` makes use of the [survex-rs](https://github.com/anorthall/survex-rs) library to read Survex 3D files,
which in turn uses the [Survex](https://survex.com/) `img.c` library directly.
